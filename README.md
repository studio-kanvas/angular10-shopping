# NgShoppingCart

An Angular component library to create shopping carts. Based on it's predecessor for Angular.js with tons of improvements.

> This is a work in progress. We are now in beta and getting close to a stable release. 

# Features

- All the previous components with more features.
- An extra `CartShowcaseComponent` to help e-commerce applications to quickly build screens to display their available products.
- Generic services to use your own data structures for cart items. Only a few required methods needs to be implemented to interop with the library.
- A default `CartItem` class ready to go, easy to replace.
- Several built-in `CartService` implementations to persist cart information in different ways.
- Easily customizable styles with `Sass` variables

> This library is compatible with Angular version >=5
